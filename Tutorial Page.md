#### Preface

​		[About author](index.html)

​		Welcome to Jinhan's Blog, tutorial of Machine Learning Algorithms. I am writing this because I found a lot of books or other tutorial is either focusing too much about the math, it start with the Math and ends with the Math, making people forget what kind of problem the Algorithm is really solving, or it is doesn't have the correct implementation of the algorithm, it made me really frustrated when I finally read a lot of tutorial, and I can not run the code provided. So I decided to write my own tutorial. I hope it can help people like me.



​		I may make some mistakes in the tutorial, because I am not a expert, I am a learner like you as well. If you find any mistakes, or any improvement on the tutorial, please contact me via email: meijinhan0819@gmail.com, or wechat: 1814292527; I would be really appreciate. Besides, if you want to discuss about the algorithm with me, you can also get in touch with me. I am happy if you want to share my tutorial with friends, if you want to repost my tutorial, please contact me first,



​		In the end, I hope this series of tutorials will give you a glimpse on Machine Learning, and an intuition of how each algorithm works. Cheers!
